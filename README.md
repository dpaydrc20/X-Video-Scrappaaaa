To handle the extraction of video URLs from Twitter more reliably, consider using a library that is specifically designed for interacting with Twitter's API and parsing content. One such library is `yt_dlp`, a fork of `youtube-dl`, which supports a wide range of sites including Twitter.

First, install `yt_dlp`:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

Then, you can use the following script to download the video:

```python
import yt_dlp

def download_twitter_video(tweet_url, output_filename):
    ydl_opts = {
        'outtmpl': output_filename,
        'format': 'best',
    }

    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        ydl.download([tweet_url])

tweet_url = 'https://twitter.com/Dogepay_DRC20/status/1791286483175063586'
output_filename = 'twitter_video.mp4'

download_twitter_video(tweet_url, output_filename)
print(f"Video downloaded as {output_filename}")
```

This script does the following:
1. Configures `yt_dlp` with the desired output filename and video format.
2. Uses `yt_dlp` to download the video from the given Twitter URL.

`yt_dlp` handles the extraction and downloading process, making it a more robust solution for downloading videos from various sites, including Twitter.
